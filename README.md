# Image-Recognition-using-Google-Cloud-API
# Abstract
SnapWik is an image recognition application build on an android operating system, which uploads a soft copy of a captured image to the Google vision engine for detecting the labels by using machine learning techniques and based on finding this application shows those results on the screen. The results are subdivided into labels, texts and landmarks and each category has its confidence level from 0(low confidence) to 1(high confidence) for all the extracted data from this image. The application is useful in identifying unknown objects, like for tourists who want to find the name of the landmarks or an object as well. Similarly, it has more use cases for plant biologists for identifying flora and fauna of any specific plant species. As SnapWik also processes the text images, it will be helpful to understand foreign language signs on board for the travellers. These travellers can also take this app for their safari adventure where they can recognize animals, its name, class etc. by taking the picture using the inbuilt camera of this application.
